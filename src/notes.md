## Timesheet
* 03h20: First setup, learn about scala project structure. Created first 2 models and 2 controllers. Created root page that shows the projects in a list.
* 06h00: TODO encoders/decoders. First attempt at storing new projects. Updated homepage. Updated routes. Suffered through worthless documentation and non existing forum posts. Trying to figure out the worthless "The request body was malformed." error message.
